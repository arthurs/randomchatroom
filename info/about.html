  <p>
  This started as a social experiment as part of a guest lecture at an esteemed institute of learning and will continue as a social experiment.</p>
 
  <p>It was set up as a way for those people in the audience to ask questions who were too shy.  This was the beginning of the madness.</p>

  <p>If you want to help develop the madness (you don't have to be a coder), join the google group at <a
      href="http://groups.google.com/group/randomchatroom">http://groups.google.com/group/randomchatroom</a> . Also in the interests of having a diverse team,
  we are particularly interested in having more women contributors.</p>
  
  <ul>
        <li>source code - <a href="https://github.com/starkcoffee/randomchatroom">https://github.com/starkcoffee/randomchatroom</a></li>
        <li>README - <a href="https://github.com/starkcoffee/randomchatroom/blob/master/README">https://github.com/starkcoffee/randomchatroom/blob/master/README</a></li>
        <li>issue tracking - <a href="https://github.com/starkcoffee/randomchatroom/issues">https://github.com/starkcoffee/randomchatroom/issues</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>It will be a fun learning experience at the very least. We are all learning on the fly. Even if you have no programming experience at all, if you want to
  get involved, it's easy and we are here to help.</p>
