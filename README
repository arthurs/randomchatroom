Who can contribute and how?  
-------------------
Anyone who is interested... this is a learning project and social experiment :)  We are all various level of n00bs here :)  Feel free to
ask questions in the chatroom or on the google group - don't be shy ;)

Please join the google group for help on getting involved http://groups.google.com/group/randomchatroom

To run this application locally:
--------------------------------

# Fork this repository
# Clone that repository onto your local machine
# Get the code onto your local machine by doing a clone of your forked repository
# Run it using the Google App Engine SDK

Learning resources
-------------------
You'll need to get up to speed with git, python and Google App Engine and have them installed. Don't use python 3.

To learn git we recommend you try:

http://gitimmersion.com

To learn Google App Engine (as well as how to run it locally) do the Getting Started - Python tutorial from the Google App Engine website.

To learn python we recommend .. ??? there are heaps of resources out there (dive into python is a free book but geared more to those who already know
programmig), I don't know of a really good one sorry.

This is how we work:
--------------------

# Do your changes to your local repository that you cloned from your fork (yeh.. mouthful!)
# Test your changes on your local google app engine
# Commit them to your local repository
# Push them to your forked repositoy on github
# Do a pull request via github so that your changes get incorporated into this (the authorative) repository
# A gatekeeper will then deploy them (in time there will be more core committers and deployers)

Why are there no tests??
------------------------
Yeh... good point .. :/ :/ :?  COMING SOON!!!
